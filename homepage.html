        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>At Rescue 22 our mission is to serve those who served us. On average, 22 veterans commit suicide
            a day and while that is a lot, even one suicide is too many. Anything our consumers buy here helps 
            toward our mission. When you make a purchase we at Rescue 22 put 10% of what you spend into rescuing a dog, having that dog trained,
            certified as a service dog, and given to a veteran in need.</p>
